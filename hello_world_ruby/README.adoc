= The Hello Ruby World

Firstly, let's use Cypher as a query language and want to install the Neoj4 server as standard as possible on my OSX, via brew, and open the web interface in the browser for comfort:

[source, bash]
----
brew install neo4j && neo4j start
open http://localhost:7474/
----

Secondly, just make a new directory for the project with a file `hello.rb` for our script. We are going to use https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max DeMarzi]'s nice https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography[Neography] library, currently probably the best maintained Neo4j driver for Ruby.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/peterneubauer/blogs.git
cd blogs/hello_world_ruby
bundle install
----

Using http://docs.neo4j.org/refcard/2.0/[Cypher] to interact with neo4j through the https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography/wiki/Transactions#start-of-content[transactional REST endpoint], the interface becomes very uniform in parsing the underlying HTTP responses - basically arrays of data coming back from Neo4j.
Now, `hello.rb` looks something like this:

[source, ruby]
----
include::hello.rb[]
----

Executing the file with

[source, bash]
----
ruby hello.rb
----

Results in an output of

[source]
----
Got column: Hello
Got column: CRUEL
Got column: World
----
